<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%; color: #638f01;">Hello!</span></strong></p>
</center>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;">The name's Yuki Heather Morgan. I'm a writer, both creative and non, currently located in the US state of Massachusetts. I like to think my background in English Literature and Environmental Policy and Decision Making&mdash;shout-out to my beloved alma mater, the University of Puget Sound!&mdash;comes through in my work. Death, regeneration, humanity, and monstrosity are themes I instinctively gravitate to. The network of connections between them never ends.</p>
<p class="indented" style="text-indent: 40px;">Embracing my queerness and biracial identity (Japanese and Welsh) is deeply important to me. Representation matters, and sustainability isn't sustainable if it isn't also equitable. Creative expression connects people together; legislation, protest, and especially donations materially benefit marginalized groups. Sites like <a style="color: #638f01;" href="https://greatnonprofits.org/">Great Nonprofits</a> can help you find local causes to support.</p>
